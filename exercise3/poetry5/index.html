The</br>
re is a </br>
feeling of Et</br>
ernity in youth,Wh</br>
ich makes us amend for e</br>
verything.To be young is to be</br>
as one of the Immortal Gods.One half o</br>
f time indeed is flown — the other half remains</br>
in store for us with all its countless treasures;For ther</br>
e is no line drawn, and we see no limit to our hopes and wishes.We</br>
 make the coming age our own — the vast,the unbounded prolies before us.</br>
